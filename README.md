# Cryptomatic

**--ARCHIVED--**  
 An encoding/decoding program for Trevor and I

## Development / Testing

The game was written in HTML so that it can be opened in Google Chrome and run. If you wish to continue development or use it for yourself, simple clone or download the repository and open "main.html" in Google Chrome (Other web browsers may work but aren't necessarily supported).

Any key file can be used as long as it contains all characters that you wish to include in your message. Use the KeyCreator program to turn any file into a proper key by filling in the extra characters.
